# BobcatsCoyotesFoxes
A MSOE midterm project that focuses on applying data science techniques by analyzing a dataset from a biology research paper. This project determines the best approach for addressing research questions. 

## Introduction
Understanding the distribution and behavior of various species is fundamental to ecology, as it helps ecologists understand the relationship betweem organsims and their environments. There is a lot ecological signifigance behind tracking such species, as researchers can see precisely when individual animals depart from one location and arrive at another. Such insights reveal a individual animal’s seasonal movements, feeding locations and more. Such information is valuable because the more ecologists know about animals’ seasonal usage of habitats, the more they can protect the areas the animals need to survive.

## The Hypothesis
Given that adult Gray Foxes have a greater average body length than adult Bobcats, and a smaller average body length than adult Coyotes, we hypothesize that Gray Fox scat will exhibit a significantly larger average diameter than Bobcat scat, but a smaller average diameter than Coyote scat.
